// Struct to represent a pair of particle indices and their distance

// Function to create the nearest neighbor table

// Get pointers to the particle positions, velocities, and accelerations

// Create an empty vector to hold the nearest neighbor table

// Loop over all pairs of particles

// Calculate the distance between the two particles

// Add the particle pair to the nearest neighbor table
